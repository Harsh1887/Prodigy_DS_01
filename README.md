# 🌍 World Population Dataset Analysis (2001–2022)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project provides a detailed analysis of global population data spanning from 2001 to 2022. Using Python and key data visualization libraries, the project explores population trends by country and gender. The analysis highlights shifts in demographics, compares top and bottom populations, and visualizes growth across years.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes annual population figures for various countries with a focus on:

| Series Code             | Description                         |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| SP.POP.TOTL             | Total population                    |
| SP.POP.TOTL.MA.IN       | Male population (absolute)          |
| SP.POP.TOTL.FE.IN       | Female population (absolute)        |
| SP.POP.TOTL.MA.ZS       | Male population (% of total)        |
| SP.POP.TOTL.FE.ZS       | Female population (% of total)      |
